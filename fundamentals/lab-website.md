# Editing the Lab Website

## Log-in to the website

The lab website is edited through [UW wordpress](https://wiscweb.wisc.edu/), you will need to be on the campus VPN in order to access it, but you can log-in with your netid. Wordpress has some tools for previewing the website, but you can see how things currently look [here](https://sbel.wisc.edu/).

Once you're logged in, you can access the SBEL site from the dropdown in the top left under "My sites".

## What to add?

### People Page
If you are new to the lab, you should add an entry to the "People" page for yourself, by going to the sidebar and hitting "Faculty/Staff Members" > "Add New".

The fields should be self-explanatory, if you aren't sure where a particular field will end up you can always compare an already-filled out page to the way it shows up on the lab website. The fields you should fill out are **First/Last Name**, **Credentials**, **Headshot**, **Email**, **Title** and optionally **Biography**.

### News and Projects
It's good to keep both the News and Projects sections updated with the current goings-on in the lab. The News section is ideal for smaller things that can be summarized in a couple sentences or less, with or without pictures. The Projects section is where larger updates should go; those should definitely have pictures or a video and could have a paragraph or more of description. Check out existing posts for details. 

To add news or projects, go to the sidebar and select "Posts" > "Add New". On the right side of the pop-up, there are check-boxes to determine which feed this post will go under. If you are creating a post for an older project, change the "Published" date on the right side to a date that is more appropriate for when the project actually happened, this way the posts appear on the news feed in a more coherent order.
