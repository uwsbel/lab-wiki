## Reporting and Tracking Issues

We will be gradually transitioning to MantisBT from FlySpray. From this point forwards, please reference Mantis for reporting and monitoring issues/tasks. Thank you.
Below are instructions for how to create an account on the new system and how to report issues/tasks for Colin and Moubarak to investigate.

### Creating an account:

1. Navigate to our [MantisBT login page](https://wacc.wisc.edu/mantisbt/)
2. Click "Signup for a new account"
3. Choose a username and email, I recommend using the same credentials as your Euler account.
4. Continue through registration process
    - The confirmation email will have the subject line: [MantisBT] Account registration
    - Please do NOT reuse the same password as Euler. I recommend an alphanumerical string with special characters.
5. Tada!

### Reporting an Issue:

1. From the MantisBT landing page, click "Report Issue"
2. If prompted, choose the correct project this issue/task is related too.
    - Before reporting any issue, be sure your session is attached to the relevant project already by double-checking the project dropdown in the top right of the website.
    - Only tasks related to the currently selected project will display.
3. Enter all required details and applicable details
    - While not required, it is helpful to provide "steps to reproduce".
    - The more information provided, the better!
4. Click "Submit Issue"
5. Depending on your user settings you will receive notification emails when there are updates for any issue/task you reported.
