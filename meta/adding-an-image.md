# Adding an Image

Images in this wiki are not stored directly amongst the page markdown files. Rather, they are stored under the `/images/` directory in a subdirectory matching the location of the markdown file in which they appear.

For example, if you were adding the image `myimage.png` to the page `meta/adding-an-image.md`, you would store `myimage.png` at `/images/meta/myimage.png` and link it as `![My Image](/lab-wiki/images/meta/myimage.png)`
