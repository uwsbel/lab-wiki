# Editing the Source

As this wiki is hosted on GitHub, editing the source code requires access to the [**uwsbel**](https://github.com/uwsbel) GitHub group.

To edit the source, you have two options. You can navigate to https://github.com/uwsbel/lab-wiki and make the changes right in your browser, or you can clone the repository to your local computer and use your favorite text editor to edit the sources that way. Both methods work, so it's a matter of personal preference as to which one you use.
